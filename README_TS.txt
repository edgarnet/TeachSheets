Welcome to TeachSheets 1.0
by Edgar Perez

Make sure you have "TeachSheets.java", "DataProcess.java", 
and "OmegaFile.txt" downloaded and installed
in the same project.

To start run the "TeachSheets.java" file. 

Since "OmegaFile.txt" has data from a sample of 25 students, 
type any number from 25 or below for the first prompt: 
"How many students are in your class?"

The data will then be organized in a "sheet" which you can 
customize by choosing (1) in the menu below:

"Enter (1) Change Grade (2) Weight Grades (3) Homework Average (4) Midterm Average (5) Final Average (6) Exit"

To change a grade, the first prompt will ask you to 
"Enter Student Number". Once typed the next prompt will look
for a number from "1-4" to change a homework assignment, "5-6" 
to change a midterm exam, or "7" to change the final exam.
You will then need to "Enter Grade Percentage" which will
replace the previous grade. It is recomended that all 
changes to grades be completed before moving on to 
setting weights (2). If you decide to change a grade after 
weights are applied, just input the same weights for 
option (2) once again.

To set weights for each type of assignment, choose (2) from
the menu above. The first prompt will ask for the Homework's 
weight, the second for the midterm's weight, and the last
for the final's weight all as decimals. *It is required that 
all weights add up to 1.* Once typed each student will receive
a grade based on the weights provided.

To see the average grade for a homework assignment, choose (3)
from the menu above. The prompt will ask for which homework assignment
between "1-4" to be averaged. Once typed the average for the homework
assignment chosen will be displayed below the prompts.

To see the average grade for a midterm exam, choose (4) from the 
menu above. The prompt will ask for which midterm exam between "1-2"
to be averaged. Once typed the average for the midterm exam chosen 
will be displayed below the prompts.

To see the average grade for the final exam, simply choose (5)
from the menu above.

To exit from the program choose (6) from the menu. Your data will be
saved in the same file used to provide the sample grades.

Thank you for reading the TeachSheets Manual!
